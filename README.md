The AMC Smart City Platform represents a transformative approach to urban governance, built to serve millions of citizens in Ahmedabad. The platform consists of two major components: a Flutter-based Citizen Super App and a React-based Integrated Command & Control System (ICCS) for municipal officials.

The system architecture follows a microservices pattern with 10+ independent services handling different civic functions including property tax, water supply, waste management, grievance redressal, and payment processing. Each service is independently scalable and maintainable, ensuring high availability and resilience.
